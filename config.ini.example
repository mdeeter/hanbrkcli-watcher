# HandBrake Folder Watcher - Configuration File Example
#
# This is an example configuration file showing all available options.
# Copy this to 'config.ini' and customize the values to your preferences.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.

[Directories]
# ==================== Directory Configuration ====================
#
# All directory paths can be either:
#   - Relative to the script location (e.g., "input", "my_videos/input")
#   - Absolute paths (e.g., "/Users/username/Videos/input", "C:\Videos\input")
#
# The script will automatically create these directories if they don't exist.

# Input directory: Where to watch for new video files
# Default: input
input_dir = input

# Output directory: Where encoded files will be saved
# Default: output
output_dir = output

# Done directory: Where original files are moved after successful encoding
# Default: done
done_dir = done

# Examples of custom paths:
# input_dir = /Users/username/Videos/ToEncode
# input_dir = C:\Users\username\Videos\ToEncode
# input_dir = ../shared/videos/input


[Encoding]
# ==================== Encoding Configuration ====================

# HandBrake preset to use for encoding
# Run "HandBrakeCLI --preset-list" to see all available presets
#
# Popular presets:
#   Very Fast presets (fastest encoding):
#     - Very Fast 480p30
#     - Very Fast 720p30 (default)
#     - Very Fast 1080p30
#
#   Fast presets (good balance):
#     - Fast 480p30
#     - Fast 720p30
#     - Fast 1080p30
#
#   High Quality presets (slower, better quality):
#     - HQ 720p30 Surround
#     - HQ 1080p30 Surround
#
#   Hardware accelerated (if available):
#     - H.265 Apple VideoToolbox 1080p
#     - H.265 NVENC 1080p
#
# Default: Very Fast 720p30
preset = Very Fast 720p30


[FileHandling]
# ==================== File Handling Configuration ====================

# Video file extensions to watch for (comma-separated, include the dot)
# The script will only process files with these extensions.
# 
# Common video formats:
#   .mp4   - MPEG-4 Part 14
#   .avi   - Audio Video Interleave

video_extensions = .mp4,.avi,.mkv,.mov,.wmv,.flv,.webm,.m4v,.mpg,.mpeg

# Time to wait for file to stabilize before processing (in seconds)
# The script waits this many seconds for the file size to remain constant
# before starting encoding. Increase this if large files are being processed
# before they finish copying.
#
# Default: 3
stabilization_time = 3

# Interval between file size checks during stabilization (in seconds)
# How often to check if the file size has changed.
#
# Default: 1
stabilization_check_interval = 1


[Logging]
# ==================== Logging Configuration ====================

# Log directory: Where log files will be saved
# Can be relative or absolute path.
# Default: logs
log_dir = logs

# Logging level: Controls how much detail is logged
